<p>De <time>1994/1996</time>, Schneider va donner plus de 30 conférences dans le monde, concerning conspiracy theories in which he claimed
	to be leaking information exposing them. However, Schneider was never able or willing to prove his allegations (e.g. showing the

	cover-ups, black budgets, and UFOs. Schneider was never able or willing to prove his allegations (e.g. showing the entrance to Dulce
	Base). His claims received little mainstream notice, but caused quite a buzz in UFO enthusiast circles. Some suggest Schneider was
	murdered after several attempts on his life & his family for exposing the truth about the U.S government's black budget & speaking
	openly about what's really happened in underground with the Alien agenda.

<p>Le 1996-01-17 est retrouvé mort dans son appartement de Wilsonville (Oregon), apparemment plusieurs jours après sa mort (peut-être une
	semaine), un tuyau en caoutchouc enroulé 3 fois autour de son cou. Tim Swartz writes that "Clackamas County Coroner's office initially
	attributed Philip Schneider's death to a stroke or heart attack." Some suggest Schneider was murdered; supposedly because he was leaking
	information to the public, unveiling conspiracies. He in fact claimed to have avoided 13 murder attempts taken on his life during the
	time in which he was lecturing on conspiracy theories. He suffered multiple physical illnesses (osteoporosis, cancer, injuries).
	Officially, suicide is now stated as the cause of death -- which adds up to one apparent and three official causes of death, which is
	three too many.
