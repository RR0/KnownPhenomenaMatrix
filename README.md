RR0
===

RR0 is a webapp that provides a set of facilities for consulting (UFO-related) data.

=== Data-centric ===
The pages contain data, not how to format it. Formatting is handled by dynamic analysis (parsing) of data.

==== Contextual ====
Data is always analyzed (formatted) with a context. If "1947" is encountered and interpreted as a date year, 
is it becoming a context for the rest of the data parsing. If "07" is encountered and interpreted as a date month, 
then "June 1947" is assumed to be the formatted result of it.
