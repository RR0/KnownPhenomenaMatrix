<p class="abstract">With the commemoration in <time>2007-10</time> of the Sputnik launch, space exploration celebrated
  its 50th anniversary. Despite impressive technological and scientific achievements the fascination for space has
  weakened during the last decades. One contributing factor has been the gradual disappearance of mankind’s hope of
  discovering extraterrestrial life within its close neighbourhood. In striking contrast and since the middle of the
  20th century, a non-negligible proportion of the population have already concluded that intelligent beings from other
  worlds do exist and visit Earth through space vehicles popularly called Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). In light
  of the continuous public interest for the UFO enigma symbolized by the recent widely diffused media announcements on
  the release of French and English governmental files; and considering the approach of broadening the strategies of the
  "Active SETI" approach and the existence of a rich multi-disciplinary UFO documentation of potential interest for
  SETI; this paper describes some past scientific attempts to demonstrate the physical reality of the phenomena and
  potentially the presence on Earth of probes of extraterrestrial origin. Details of the different instrumented field
  studies deployed by scientists and organizations during the period 1950–1990 in the USA, Canada and Europe are
  provided. In conclusion it will be argued that while continuing the current radio/optical SETI searches, there is the
  necessity to maintain sustaining attention to the topic of anomalous aerospace phenomena and to develop new rigorous
  research approaches <span class="source">&copy; 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</span></p>
