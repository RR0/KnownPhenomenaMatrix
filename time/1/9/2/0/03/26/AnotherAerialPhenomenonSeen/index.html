<p> Another phenomenon of the air was sighted by a number of local people last night. Whether the sight which was
  observed was a comet or an unusually large shooting star is not known. The phenomenon was observed at 8:15 o'clock and
  from the description given by those who saw it, many are inclined to believe that the phenomenon was no other than a
  comet.</p>
<p>The phenomenon was observed in the northeast last night and from the best description that has been given it is
  believed that it was a giant sky-rocket shot through the air. The night was an unusual one and proved a puzzle to all
  who saw the sight.</p>
