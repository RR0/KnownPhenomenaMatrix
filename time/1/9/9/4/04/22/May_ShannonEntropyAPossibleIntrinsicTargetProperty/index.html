<title>Shannon Entropy as an Intrinsic Target Property: Toward a Reductionist Model of Anomalous Cognition</title>
<!--#include virtual="/header-end.html" -->
<p class="abstract">We propose that the average total change of Shannon's entropy is a candidate for an intrinsic target
  property. An intrinsic target property is one that is completely independent of psychological factors and can be
  associated solely with a physical property of the target. We analyzed the results of two lengthy experiments that were
  conducted from 1992 through 1993 and found a significant correlation ([r.sub.s] = 0.337, df = 31, t= 1.99, p [less
  than or equal to] 0.028) with an absolute measure of the quality of the anomalous cognition (AC). In addition, we
  found that the quality of the AC was significantly better for dynamic targets than for static targets (t = 1.71, df=
  36, p [less than or equal to] 0.048). The 1993 correlation with the change of entropy replicated a similar finding
  from our 1992 study. Using Monte Carlo techniques, we demonstrate that the observed correlations were not due to some
  unforeseen artifact with the entropy calculation, but perhaps the correlation can be accounted for because of the
  difference in some other measure between static and dynamic targets. The Monte Carlo results and the significant
  correlations with static targets in the 1992 study, however, suggest otherwise. We describe the methodology, the
  calculations, and correlations in detail and provide guidelines for those who may wish to conduct similar studies.</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The psychophysical properties of the five known senses are well known (Reichert, 1992). At the "front end," they
    share similar properties. For example, each system possesses receptor cells that convert some form of energy (e.g.,
    photons for the visual system, sound waves for the audio system) into electrochemical signals. The transfer
    functions are sigmoidal; that is, there is a threshold for physical excitation, a linear region, and a saturation
    level above which more input produces the same output. How these psychophysical reactions translate to sensational
    experience is not well understood, but all the systems do possess an awareness threshold similar to the subliminal
    threshold for the visual system.</p>
  <p>Since all the known senses appear to share these common properties, it is reasonable to expect that if anomalous
    cognition (AC)(1) is mediated through some additional "sensory" system, then it too should share similar properties
    at the preperceptual cellular front end. For example, a putative AC sensory system should possess receptor cells
    that have a sigmoidal transfer function and exhibit threshold and saturation phenomena. As far as we know, there are
    no candidate neurons in the peripheral systems whose functions are currently not understood. So if receptor cells
    exist, it is likely that they will be found in the central nervous system. Since 1989, our laboratory has been
    conducting a search for such receptor sites (May, Luke, Trask, & Frivold, 1990); that activity continues.</p>
  <p>There is a second way in which receptor-like behavior might be seen in lieu of a neurophysiology study. If either
    an energy carrier for AC or something that correlated with it were known, then it might be possible to infer
    sigmoidal functioning at the behavioral level as opposed to the cellular level. …</p>
