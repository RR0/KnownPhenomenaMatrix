<p>During <time>1974</time> and early <time>1975</time> a number of controlled experiments were conducted to see if
  various types of target material could be successfully described with remote viewing. The results reported by Puthoff
  and Targ (1975) indicated success with a wide range of material, from "technical" targets like a xerox machine to
  natural settings, like a swimming pool. But these and some of the subsequent experiments were criticized on
  statistical and methodological grounds; we briefly describe one of the experiments and criticisms of it to show the
  kinds of problems that existed in the early scientific effort.</p>
<p>The largest series during in the <time>1973/1975</time> time period involved remote viewing of natural sites. Sites
  were randomly selected for each trial from a set of 100 possibilities. They were selected "without replacement,"
  meaning that sites were not reused once they had been selected. The series included eight viewers, including two
  supplied by the sponsor. Many of the descriptions showed a high degree of subjective correspondence, and the overall
  statistical results were quite striking for most of the viewers.</p>
<p>Critics attacked these experiments on a number of issues, including the selection of sites without replacement and
  the statistical scoring method used. The results were scored by having a blind judge attempt to match the target
  material with the transcripts of the responses. A large fraction of the matches were successful. But critics noted
  that some successful matching could be attained just from cues contained in the transcripts of the material, like when
  a subject mentioned in one session what the target had been in the previous session. Because sites were selected
  without replacement, knowing what the answer was on one day would exclude that target site from being the answer on
  any other day. There was no way to determine the extent to which these problems influenced the results. The criticisms
  of these and subsequent experiments, while perhaps unwelcome at the time, have resulted in substantially improved
  methodology in these experiments.</p>
