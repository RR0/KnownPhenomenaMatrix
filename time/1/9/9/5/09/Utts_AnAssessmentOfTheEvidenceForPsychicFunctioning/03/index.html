  <h3>Early Operational Successes and Evaluation</h3>
  <p>According to Puthoff and Targ (1975) the scientific research endeavor at SRI may never have been supported had it
    not been for three apparent operational successes in the early days of the program. These are detailed by Puthoff
    and Targ (1975), although the level of the matches is not clearly delineated.</p>
  <p>One of the apparent successes concerned the "West Virginia Site" in which two remote viewers purportedly identified
    an underground secret facility. One of them apparently named codewords and personnel in this facility accurately
    enough that it set off a security investigation to determine how that information could have been leaked. Based only
    on the coordinates of the site, the viewer first described the above ground terrain, then proceeded to describe
    details of the hidden underground site.</p>
  <p>The same viewer then claimed that he could describe a similar Communist Bloc site and proceeded to do so for a site
    in the Urals. According to Puthoff and Targ "the two reports for the West Virginia Site, and the report for the
    Urals Site were verified by personnel in the sponsor organization as being substantially correct (p. 8)."</p>
  <p>The third reported operational success concerned an accurate description of a large crane and other information at
    a site in Semipalatinsk, USSR. Again the viewer was provided with only the geographic coordinates of the site and
    was asked to describe what was there.</p>
  <p>Although some of the information in these examples was verified to be highly accurate, the evaluation of
    operational work remains difficult, in part because there is no chance baseline for comparison (as there is in
    controlled experiments) and in part because of differing expectations of different evaluators. For example, a
    government official who reviewed the Semipalatinsk work concluded that there was no way the remote viewer could have
    drawn the large gantry crane unless "he actually saw it through remote viewing, or he was informed of what to draw
    by someone knowledgeable of [the site]." Yet that same analyst concluded that "the remote viewing of [the site] by
    subject S1 proved to be unsuccessful" because "the only positive evidence of the rail-mounted gantry crane was far
    outweighed by the large amount of negative evidence noted in the body of this analysis." In other words, the analyst
    had the expectation that in order to be "successful" a remote viewing should contain accurate information only.</p>
  <p>Another problem with evaluating this operational work is that there is no way to know with certainty that the
    subject did not speak with someone who had knowledge of the site, however unlikely that possibility may appear.
    Finally, we do not know to what degree the results in the reports were selectively chosen because they were correct.
    These problems can all be avoided with well designed controlled experiments.</p></section>

  <h3>The Early Scientific Effort at SRI</h3>
  <p>During <time>1974</time> and early <time>1975</time> a number of controlled experiments were conducted to see if
    various types of target material could be successfully described with remote viewing. The results reported by
    Puthoff and Targ (1975) indicated success with a wide range of material, from "technical" targets like a xerox
    machine to natural settings, like a swimming pool. But these and some of the subsequent experiments were criticized
    on statistical and methodological grounds; we briefly describe one of the experiments and criticisms of it to show
    the kinds of problems that existed in the early scientific effort.</p>
  <p>The largest series during in the <time>1973/1975</time> time period involved remote viewing of natural sites. Sites
    were randomly selected for each trial from a set of 100 possibilities. They were selected "without replacement,"
    meaning that sites were not reused once they had been selected. The series included eight viewers, including two
    supplied by the sponsor. Many of the descriptions showed a high degree of subjective correspondence, and the overall
    statistical results were quite striking for most of the viewers.</p>
  <p>Critics attacked these experiments on a number of issues, including the selection of sites without replacement and
    the statistical scoring method used. The results were scored by having a blind judge attempt to match the target
    material with the transcripts of the responses. A large fraction of the matches were successful. But critics noted
    that some successful matching could be attained just from cues contained in the transcripts of the material, like
    when a subject mentioned in one session what the target had been in the previous session. Because sites were
    selected without replacement, knowing what the answer was on one day would exclude that target site from being the
    answer on any other day. There was no way to determine the extent to which these problems influenced the results.
    The criticisms of these and subsequent experiments, while perhaps unwelcome at the time, have resulted in
    substantially improved methodology in these experiments.</p>

  <h3>An Overall Analysis of the SRI Experiments: 1973-1988</h3>
  <p>In <time>1988</time> an analysis was made of all of the experiments conducted at SRI from <time>1973</time> until
    that time (May et al, 1988). The analysis was based on all 154 experiments conducted during that era, consisting of
    over 26,000 individual trials. Of those, almost 20,000 were of the forced choice type and just over a thousand were
    laboratory remote viewings. There were a total of 227 subjects in all experiments.</p>
  <p>The statistical results were so overwhelming that results that extreme or more so would occur only about once in
    every 10<sup>20</sup> such instances if chance alone is the explanation (i.e., the p-value was less than
    10<sup>-20</sup>). Obviously some explanation other than chance must be found. Psychic functioning may not be the
    only possibility, especially since some of the earlier work contained methodological problems. However, the fact
    that the same level of functioning continued to hold in the later experiments, which did not contain those flaws,
    lends support to the idea that the methodological problems cannot account for the results. In fact, there was a
    talented group of subjects (labeled G1 in that report) for whom the effects were stronger than for the group at
    large. According to Dr. May, the majority of experiments with that group were conducted later in the program, when
    the methodology had been substantially improved.</p>
  <p>In addition to the statistical results, a number of other questions and patterns were examined. A summary of the
    results revealed the following:</p>
  <ol><li>"Free response" remote viewing, in which subjects describe a target, was much more successful than "forced
    choice" experiments, in which subjects were asked to choose from a small set of possibilities.</li>
    <li>There was a group of six selected individuals whose performance far exceeded that of unselected subjects. The
      fact that these same selected individuals consistently performed better than others under a variety of protocols
      provides a type of replicability that helps substantiate the validity of the results. If methodological problems
      were responsible for the results, they should not have affected this group differently from others.</li>
    <li>Mass-screening efforts found that about one percent of those who volunteered to be tested were consistently
      successful at remote viewing. This indicates that remote viewing is an ability that differs across individuals,
      much like athletic ability or musical talent. (Results of mass screenings were not included in the formal analysis
      because the conditions were not well-controlled, but the subsequent data from subjects found during mass-screening
      were included.)</li>
    <li>Neither practice nor a variety of training techniques consistently worked to improve remote viewing ability. It
      appears that it is easier to find than to train good remote viewers.</li>
    <li>It is not clear whether or not feedback (showing the subject the right answer) is necessary, but it does appear
      to provide a psychological boost that may increase performance.</li>
    <li>Distance between the target and the subject does not seem to impact the quality of the remote viewing.</li>
    <li>Electromagnetic shielding does not appear to inhibit performance.</li>
    <li>There is compelling evidence that precognition, in which the target is selected after the subject has given the
      description, is also successful.</li>
    <li>There is no evidence to support anomalous perturbation (psychokinesis), i.e. physical interaction with the
      environment by psychic means.</li></ol>

  <h3>Consistency with Other Laboratories in the Same Era</h3>
  <p>One of the hallmarks of a real phenomenon is that its magnitude is replicable by various researchers working under
    similar conditions. The results of the overall SRI analysis are consistent with results of similar experiments in
    other laboratories. For instance, an overview of forced choice precognition experiments (Honorton and Ferrari, 1989)
    found an average "effect size" per experimenter of 0.033, whereas all forced choice experiments at SRI resulted in a
    similar effect size of .052. The comparison is not ideal since the SRI forced choice experiments were not
    necessarily precognitive and they used different types of target material than the standard card-guessing
    experiments.</p>
  <p>Methodologically sound remote viewing has not been undertaken at other laboratories, but a similar regime called
    the ganzfeld (described in more detail in Section 5) has shown to be similarly successful. The largest collection of
    ganzfeld experiments was conducted from 1983 to 1989 at the Psychophysical Research Laboratories in Princeton, NJ.
    Those experiments were also reported by separating novices from experienced subjects. The overall effect size for
    novice remote viewing at SRI was 0.164, while the effect size for novices in the ganzfeld at PRL was a very similar
    0.17. For experienced remote viewers at SRI the overall effect size was 0.385; for experienced viewers in the
    ganzfeld experiments it was 0.35. These consistent results across laboratories help refute the idea that the
    successful experiments at any one lab are the result of fraud, sloppy protocols or some methodological problem and
    also provide an indication of what can be expected in future experiments.</p>
