<p>There are two basic types of functioning that are generally considered under the broad heading of psychic or
  paranormal abilities. These are classically known as <b>extrasensory perception (ESP)</b>, in which one acquires
  information through unexplainable means and <b>psychokinesis</b>, in which one physically manipulates the environment
  through unknown means. The SAIC laboratory uses more neutral terminology for these abilities; they refer to ESP as <b>anomalous
    cognition (AC)</b> and to psychokinesis as <b>anomalous perturbation (AP)</b>. The vast majority of work at both SRI
  and SAIC investigated anomalous cognition rather than anomalous perturbation, although there was some work done on the
  latter.</p>
<p>Anomalous cognition is further divided into categories based on the apparent source of the information. If it appears
  to come from another person, the ability is called <b>telepathy</b>, if it appears to come in real time but not from
  another person it is called <b>clairvoyance</b> and if the information could have only been obtained by knowledge of
  the future, it is called <b>precognition</b>.</p>
<p>It is possible to identify apparent precognition by asking someone to describe something for which the correct answer
  isn't known until later in time. It is more difficult to rule out precognition in experiments attempting to test
  telepathy or clairvoyance, since it is almost impossible to be sure that subjects in such experiments never see the
  correct answer at some point in the future. These distinctions are important in the quest to identify an explanation
  for anomalous cognition, but do not bear on the existence issue.</p>
<p>The vast majority of anomalous cognition experiments at both SRI and SAIC used a technique known as <b>remote
  viewing</b>. In these experiments, a <b>viewer</b> attempts to draw or describe (or both) a <b>target</b> location,
  photograph, object or short video segment. All known channels for receiving the information are blocked. Sometimes the
  viewer is assisted by a <b>monitor</b> who asks the viewer questions; of course in such cases the monitor is blind to
  the answer as well. Sometimes a <b>sender</b> is looking at the target during the session, but sometimes there is no
  sender. In most cases the viewer eventually receives <b>feedback</b> in which he or she learns the correct answer,
  thus making it difficult to rule out precognition as the explanation for positive results, whether or not there was a
  sender.</p>
<p>Most anomalous cognition experiments at SRI and SAIC were of the <b>free-response</b> type, in which viewers were
  simply asked to describe the target. In contrast, a <b>forced-choice</b> experiment is one in which there are a small
  number of known choices from which the viewer must choose. The latter may be easier to evaluate statistically but they
  have been traditionally less successful than free-response experiments. Some of the work done at SAIC addresses
  potential explanations for why that might be the case.</p>
