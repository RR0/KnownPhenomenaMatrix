<p>Few human capabilities are perfectly replicable on demand. For example, even the best hitters in the major baseball
  leagues cannot hit on demand. Nor can we predict when someone will hit or when they will score a home run. In fact, we
  cannot even predict whether or not a home run will occur in a particular game. That does not mean that home runs don't
  exist.</p>
<p>Scientific evidence in the statistical realm is based on replication of the same average performance or relationship
  over the long run. We would not expect a fair coin to result in five heads and five tails over each set of ten tosses,
  but we can expect the proportion of heads and tails to settle down to about one half over a very long series of
  tosses. Similarly, a good baseball hitter will not hit the ball exactly the same proportion of times in each game but
  should be relatively consistent over the long run.</p>
<p>The same should be true of psychic functioning. Even if there truly is an effect, it may never be replicable on
  demand in the short run even if we understand how it works. However, over the long run in well-controlled laboratory
  experiments we should see a consistent level of functioning, above that expected by chance. The anticipated level of
  functioning may vary based on the individual players and the conditions, just as it does in baseball, but given
  players of similar ability tested under similar conditions the results should be replicable over the long run. In this
  report we will show that replicability in that sense has been achieved.</p>
