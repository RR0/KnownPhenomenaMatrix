<p>In any area of science, evidence based on statistics comes from comparing what actually happened to what should have
  happened by chance. For instance, without any special interventions about 51 percent of births in the United States
  result in boys. Suppose someone claimed to have a method that enabled one to increase the chances of having a baby of
  the desired sex. We could study their method by comparing how often births resulted in a boy when that was the
  intended outcome. If that percentage was higher than the chance percentage of 51 percent over the long run, then the
  claim would have been supported by statistical evidence.</p>
<p>Statisticians have developed numerical methods for comparing results to what is expected by chance. Upon observing
  the results of an experiment, the p-value is the answer to the following question: If chance alone is responsible for
  the results, how likely would we be to observe results this strong or stronger? If the answer to that question, i.e.
  the p-value is very small, then most researchers are willing to rule out chance as an explanation. In fact it is
  commonly accepted practice to say that if the p-value is 5 percent (0.05) or less, then we can rule out chance as an
  explanation. In such cases, the results are said to be statistically significant. Obviously the smaller the p-value,
  the more convincingly chance can be ruled out.</p>
<p>Notice that when chance alone is at work, we erroneously find a statistically significant result about 5 percent of
  the time. For this reason and others, most reasonable scientists require replication of non-chance results before they
  are convinced that chance can be ruled out.</p>
