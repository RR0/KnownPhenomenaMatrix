<p>At the heart of any statistical method is a definition of what should happen "randomly" or "by chance." Without a
  random mechanism, there can be no statistical evaluation.</p>
<p>There is nothing random about the responses generated in anomalous cognition experiments; in other words, there is no
  way to define what they would look like "by chance." Therefore, the random mechanism in these experiments must be in
  the choice of the target. In that way, we can compare the response to the target and answer the question: "If chance
  alone is at work, what is the probability that a target would be chosen that matches this response as well as or
  better than does the actual target?"</p>
<p>In order to accomplish this purpose, a properly conducted experiment uses a set of targets defined in advance. The
  target for each remote viewing is then selected randomly, in such a way that the probability of getting each possible
  target is known.</p>
<p>The SAIC remote viewing experiments and all but the early ones at SRI used a statistical evaluation method known as
  rank-order judging. After the completion of a remote viewing, a judge who is blind to the true target (called a blind
  judge) is shown the response and five potential targets, one of which is the correct answer and the other four of
  which are "decoys." Before the experiment is conducted each of those five choices must have had an equal chance of
  being selected as the actual target. The judge is asked to assign a rank to each of the possible targets, where a rank
  of one means it matches the response most closely, and a rank of five means it matches the least.</p>
<p>The rank of the correct target is the numerical score for that remote viewing. By chance alone the actual target
  would receive each of the five ranks with equal likelihood, since despite what the response said the target matching
  it best would have the same chance of selection as the one matching it second best and so on. The average rank by
  chance would be three. Evidence for anomalous cognition occurs when the average rank over a series of trials is
  significantly lower than three. (Notice that a rank of one is the best possible score for each viewing.)</p>
<p>This scoring method is conservative in the sense that it gives no extra credit for an excellent match. A response
  that describes the target almost perfectly will achieve the same rank of one as a response that contains only enough
  information to pick the target as the best choice out of the five possible choices. One advantage of this method is
  that it is still valid even if the viewer knows the set of possible targets. The probability of a first place match by
  chance would still be only one in five. This is important because the later SRI and many of the SAIC experiments used
  the same large set of National Geographic photographs as targets. Therefore, the experienced viewers would eventually
  become familiar with the range of possibilities since they were usually shown the answer at the end of each remote
  viewing session.</p>
<p>For technical reasons explained in Appendix 1, the effect size for a series of remote viewings using rank-order
  judging with five choices is (3.0 - average rank)/âˆš2. Therefore, small, medium and large effect sizes (0.2, 0.5 and
  0.8) correspond to average ranks of 2.72, 2.29 and 1.87, respectively. Notice that the largest effect size possible
  using this method is 1.4, which would result if every remote viewing achieved a first place ranking.</p>
