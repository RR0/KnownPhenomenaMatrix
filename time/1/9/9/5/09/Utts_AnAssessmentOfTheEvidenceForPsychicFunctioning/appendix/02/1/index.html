  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>This experiment was designed to test whether or not a sender is necessary for successful remote viewing and whether
    or not dynamic targets, consisting of short video clips, would result in more successful remote viewing than the
    standard National Geographic photographs used in most of the SRI experiments.</p>

  <h2>Method</h2>
  <p>Five experienced remote viewers participated, three of whom (#s 009, 131 and 372) were included in the experienced
    group at SRI; their identification numbers were carried over to the SAIC experiments. Each viewer worked from his or
    her home and faxed the results of the sessions to the principal investigator, Nevin Lantz, located in Pennsylvania.
    Whether the target was static or dynamic and whether or not there was a sender was randomly determined and unknown
    to the viewer. Upon receiving the fax of the response, Dr. Lantz mailed the correct answer to the viewer. The
    original response was sent to SAIC in California, where the results were judged by an analyst blind to the correct
    target. Standard rank-order judging was used.</p>
  <p>Since it is not explicitly stated, I asked Dr. May what measures were taken to make sure the viewer actually mailed
    the original response to SAIC before receiving the correct answer in the mail. He said that the original faxed
    responses were compared with the responses received by SAIC to make sure they were the same, and they all were.</p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>Each viewer contributed ten trials under each of the four possible conditions (sender/no sender and static/dynamic
    target), for a total of 40 trials per viewer. There was a moderate difference (effect size = .121, p = .08) between
    the static and dynamic targets, with the traditional National Geographic photographs faring better than the dynamic
    video clips. There was no noticeable difference based on whether or not a sender was involved, supporting the same
    conclusion reached in the overall analysis of the SRI work. Combined over all conditions and all viewers, the effect
    size was 0.124 (p = .04); for the static targets alone it was .248 (exact p = .0073) while for the dynamic targets
    it was 0.00 (p = .50).</p>

  <h2>Discussion</h2>
  <p>The SAIC staff speculated that the dynamic targets were not successful because the possibilities were too broad.
    They chose a new set of dynamic targets to be more similar to the static targets and performed another experiment
    the following year to compare the static targets with the more similar set of dynamic ones. That experiment is
    described below (Experiment 10.)</p>
