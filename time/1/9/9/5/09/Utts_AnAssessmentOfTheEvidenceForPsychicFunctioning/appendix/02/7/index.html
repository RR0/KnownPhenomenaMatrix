  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>It is often reported anecdotally that people know when they are being watched. Two experiments were conducted at
    SAIC to determine whether or not these anecdotes could be supported by a change in physiology when someone is being
    observed from a distance. The experimental design was essentially the same for the two experiments. This work was a
    conceptual replication of results reported by researchers in the Former Soviet Union (FSU), the United States and
    Scotland. The experiments in the FSU were interpreted to mean that the physiology of the recipient was being
    manipulated by the sender, an effect that if real could have frightening consequences.</p>

  <h2>Method</h2>
  <p>The "observee" was seated in a room with a video camera focused on him or her, and with galvanic skin response
    measurements being recorded. In a distant room the "observer" attempted to influence the physiology of the observee
    at randomly spaced time intervals. During those time intervals, an image of the observee appeared on a computer
    monitor watched by the observer. During "control" periods, the video camera remained focused on the observee but the
    computer monitor did not display his or her image to the observer. There were 16 "influence" periods randomly
    interspersed with 16 "control" periods, each of 30 seconds, with blank periods of 0 to 5 seconds inserted to rule
    out patterns in physiology.</p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>To determine whether or not the galvanic skin response of the observees was activated while they were being
    watched, the response during the control periods was compared with the response during the "influence" periods for
    each subject. The results were then averaged across subjects. In both experiments, there was greater activity during
    the periods of being watched than there was during the control periods. The results were statistically significant
    in each case (p = .036 and .014) and the effect sizes were similar, at 0.39 and 0.49. As preplanned, the results
    were combined, yielding an effect size of .39 (p = .005). As an interesting post hoc observation, it was noted that
    the effect was substantially stronger when the observer and observee were of opposite sexes than when they were of
    the same sex.</p>

  <h2>Discussion</h2>
  <p>This experiment differs from the others conducted at SAIC since it involves interaction between two people rather
    than one person ascertaining information about the environment or the future. It raises substantially more questions
    than it answers, since the mechanism for the shift in physiology is unknown. Possibilities range from the idea that
    the observee was able to know when the computer in the distant room was displaying his or her image, not unlike
    remote viewing, to the possibility that the observer actually did influence the physiology of the observee. Further
    experimentation as well as a review of similar past experiments may be able to shed light on this important
    question.</p>
