  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>This experiment attempted to replicate and enhance random number generator experiments conducted at SRI. In these
    types of experiments a computer randomly selects one of two choices to be the target, denoted as 0 or 1. The
    internal workings of the computer then rapidly oscillate between 0 and 1 and the subject pushes a mouse button when
    he or she thinks the internal choice matches the target choice. This process is repeated over many trials. The
    computer tabulates the results and the experiment is a success if the subject guesses the correct answer more often
    than would be expected by chance. The purpose is to see if humans can correctly guess computer-selected binary
    targets, and hopefully by extension, correctly solve binary choice problems in real situations. If that were to be
    the case, then real problems could be posed as binary ones (e.g. is the lost child still in this city or not) to
    narrow down possibilities.</p>

  <h2>Method</h2>
  <p>This SAIC experiment was designed to enhance the accuracy of binary guessing by using a statistical technique
    called sequential analysis. Rather than just one guess for each decision, the subject continues to guess until the
    computer ascertains that a decision has been reached. The computer keeps track of the number of times zero and one
    have each been guessed and announces a decision when one of the choices has clearly won out over the other, or when
    it is clear that it is essentially an ongoing tie. In the latter case, no decision is recorded. Three subjects
    participated (#s 007, 083 and 531) in this experiment. Subject #531 had been successful in similar experiments at
    SRI.</p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>Using this method for enhancing the accuracy of the guesses, subject #531, who had been successful in previous
    similar experiments, was able to achieve 76 correct answers out of 100 tries. This remarkable level of scoring for
    this type of experiment resulted in an effect size of .520 and a z-score of 5.20. The other two subjects did not
    differ from chance results, with 44 and 49 correct decisions out of 100 or 101. (One subject accidentally
    contributed an additional trial.)</p>
  <p>Although the result for subject 531 is remarkably successful, it does not represent a very efficient method of
    obtaining the decision. To reach the 100 decisions required a total of 21,337 guesses, i.e. over 200 guesses for
    each decision. Of the individual guesses, only 51.6 percent were correct, for an effect size of .032, similar to
    other forced choice experiments. Due to the large number of guesses, the corresponding z-score was 4.65. Combined
    over all three subjects, 56 percent of the 301 decisions were correct and the effect size was 0.123. The combined
    results were still statistically significant, with p = 0.017, as shown in Table 1.</p>
