<p>There were four additional experiments at SAIC, not involving remote viewing. Two of them (experiments 3 and 8)
  involved trying to measure brain activity related to psychic functioning and will be described briefly. Experiment 3
  used a <abbr title="MagnetoEnchephaloGraph">MEG</abbr> to attempt to detect anomalous signals in the brain when a
  remote stimulus was present. Due to the background noise in the brain measurements and the expected strength of the
  signal, the experimenters realized too late that they would not be able to detect a signal even if it existed.
  Experiment 8 utilized an EEG to try to detect the interruption of alpha waves when a remote viewing target was briefly
  displayed on a computer monitor in another room. The area of the brain tested was that corresponding to visual
  stimuli. No significant change in alpha was seen.</p>
<p>The remaining two experiments were replications of previous work measuring psychic functioning in areas other than
  remote viewing. They will be described in detail.</p>
