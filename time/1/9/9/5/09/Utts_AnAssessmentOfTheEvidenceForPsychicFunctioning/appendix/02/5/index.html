  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>Despite its name, this experiment did not involve lucid dreaming. Instead, it was used to test three novice remote
    viewers who were to participate in an experiment involving remote viewing while dreaming. This baseline experiment
    was designed to see if these individuals would be successful at standard laboratory remote viewing.</p>

  <h2>Method</h2>
  <p>For this baseline experiment, each of the three viewers contributed eight trials using a standard protocol common
    in the SRI era. For each trial, a target was randomly chosen from the set of 100 National Geographic targets used at
    SRI and SAIC. The target was placed on a table (so no sender was used) while the viewer, in another room, was asked
    to provide a description. The response was later blind-judged by comparing it to the target and four decoys, and
    providing a rank-ordering of the five choices.</p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>Of the three novice viewers, one obtained a promising effect size of .265, although the result was not
    statistically significant due to the small number of trials (8). Individual results were not provided for the other
    two viewers, but the overall effect size was reported as 0.088 for the three viewers.</p>
