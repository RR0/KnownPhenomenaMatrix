  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>The remote viewing in this experiment was conducted in conjunction with measurement of brain waves using an EEG.
    The purpose of the experiment was to see whether or not EEG activity would change when the target the person was
    attempting to describe was briefly displayed on a computer monitor in a distant room. Details of the EEG portion
    will be explained as experiment 8. Here, we summarize the remote viewing part of the study.</p>

  <h2>Method</h2>
  <p>Three experienced remote viewers (#s 009, 372 and 389) participated. Because of the pilot nature of the experiment,
    the number of trials differed for each viewer based on availability, with viewers 009, 372 and 389 contributing 18,
    24 and 28 trials, respectively. Although it is not good protocol to allow an unspecified number of trials, it does
    not appear that this problem can explain the results of this experiment.</p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>Responses were blind-judged using standard rank-order analysis. The effect sizes for the viewers 009, 372 and 389
    were 0.432 (p = .033), 0.354 (p = .042) and 0.177 (p = .175), respectively. The overall effect size was 0.303 (p =
    0.006).</p>
