  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>A lucid dream is a dream in which one becomes aware that he or she is dreaming, and can control subsequent events
    in the dream. This ability has apparently been successfully trained by Dr. Stephen LaBerge of the Lucidity
    Institute. He was the Principal Investigator for this experiment. The experiment was designed to see if remote
    viewing could be successfully employed while the viewer was having a lucid dream.</p>

  <h2>Method</h2>
  <p>Seven remote viewers were used; four were experienced SAIC remote viewers and three were experienced lucid dreamers
    from the Lucidity Institute. The latter three were the novice viewers used in Experiment 5. The experienced SAIC
    remote viewers were given training in lucid dreaming. The number of trials contributed by each viewer could not be
    fixed in advance because of the difficulty of attaining the lucid dream state. A total of 21 trials were conducted,
    with the seven viewers contributing anywhere from one to seven trials each. The report did not mention whether or
    not the stopping criterion was fixed in advance, but according to Dr. May the experiment was designed to proceed for
    a fixed time period and to include all sessions attained during that time period.</p>
  <p>Unlike with standard well-controlled protocols, the viewers were allowed to take the target material home with
    them. The targets, selected from the standard National Geographic pool, were sealed in opaque envelopes with covert
    threads to detect possible tampering (there were no indications of such tampering). Viewers were instructed to place
    the targets at bedside and to attempt a lucid dream in which the envelope was opened and the target viewed. Drawings
    and descriptions were then to be produced upon awakening.</p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>The results were blind-judged using the standard sum of ranks. Since the majority of viewers contributed only one
    or two trials, analysis by individual viewer would be meaningless. For the 21 trials combined, the effect size was
    0.368 (p = .046). Information was not provided to differentiate the novice remote viewers from the experienced
    ones.</p>
