  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>This experiment was designed to see if remote viewing could be used to develop a message-sending capability by
    focusing on the presence or absence of five specific features of a target. The target set was constructed in packets
    of four, with possible combinations of the absence (0) or presence (1) of each of the five features chosen to
    correspond to the numbers 00000, 01110, 10101, and 11011. This is standard practice in information theory when
    trying to send a two digit number (00, 01, 10 or 11); the remaining three bits are used for "error correction."
    Different sets of five features were used for each of ten target packs.</p>

  <h2>Method</h2>
  <p>Five viewers each contributed eight trials, but the same eight targets were used for all five viewers. There was no
    sender used, and viewers were told that each target would be in a fixed location for one week. They were to spend 15
    minutes trying to draw the target, then fax their responses to SAIC in California. The results were blind-judged and
    the binary features were coded by both the viewers and an independent analyst.</p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>The results were unsuccessful in showing any evidence of psychic functioning. Neither standard rank-order judging
    nor analysis based on the binary guesses showed any promise that this method works to send messages.</p>
