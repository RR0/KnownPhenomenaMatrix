<p>Even if we were all to agree that anomalous cognition is possible, there remains the question of whether or not it
  would have any practical use for government purposes. The answer to that question is beyond the scope of this report,
  but some speculations can be made about how to increase the usefulness.</p>
<p>First, it appears that anomalous cognition is to some extent possible in the general population. None of the ganzfeld
  experiments used exclusively selected subjects. However, it also appears that certain individuals possess more talent
  than others, and that it is easier to find those individuals than to train people. It also appears to be the case that
  certain individuals are better at some tasks than others. For instance, Viewer 372 at SAIC appears to have a facility
  with describing technical sites.</p>
<p>Second, if remote viewing is to be useful, the end users must be trained in what it can do and what it cannot. Given
  our current level of understanding, it is rarely 100 percent accurate, and there is no reliable way to learn what is
  accurate and what is not. The same is probably true of most sources of intelligence data.</p>
<p>Third, what is useful for one purpose may not be useful for another. For instance, suppose a remote viewer could
  describe the setting in which a hostage is being held. That information may not be any use at all to those unfamiliar
  with the territory, but could be useful to those familiar with it.</p>
