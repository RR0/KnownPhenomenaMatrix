  <h2>Target Selection</h2>
  <p>In addition to the question of whether or not psychic functioning is possible, the experiments at SAIC were
    designed to explore a number of hypotheses. Experiments 1 and 10 were both designed to see if there is a
    relationship between the "change in visual entropy" in the targets and the remote viewing performance.</p>
  <p>Each of the five senses with which we are familiar is a change detector. Our vision is most readily drawn to
    something that is moving, and in fact if our eyes are kept completely still, we cease to see at all. Similarly, we
    hear because of moving air, and our attention is drawn to sudden changes in sound levels. Other senses behave
    similarly. Thus, it is reasonable that if there really is a "psychic sense" then it would follow that same
    pattern.</p>
  <p>Experiments 1 and 10 were designed to test whether or not remote viewing performance would be related to a
    particular type of change in the target material, namely the "change in visual entropy." A target with a high degree
    of change would be one in which the colors changed considerably throughout the target. A detailed explanation can be
    found in the SAIC reports of this experiment, or in the article "Shannon Entropy: A Possible Intrinsic Target
    Property" by May, Spottiswoode and James, in the Journal of Parapsychology, December 1994. It was indeed found that
    there was a correlation between the change in entropy in the target and the remote viewing quality. This result was
    initially shown in Experiment 1 and replicated in Experiment 10. A simulation study matching randomly chosen targets
    to responses showed that this was unlikely to be an artifact of target complexity or other features.</p>
  <p>It is worth speculating on what this might mean for determining how psychic functioning works. Physicists are
    currently grappling with the concept of time, and cannot rule out precognition as being consistent with current
    understanding. Perhaps it is the case that we do have a psychic sense, much like our other senses, and that it works
    by scanning the future for possibilities of major change much as our eyes scan the environment for visual change and
    our ears are responsive to auditory change. That idea is consistent with anecdotal reports of precognition, which
    are generally concerned with events involving major life change. Laboratory remote viewing may in part work by
    someone directing the viewer to focus on a particular point in the future, that in which he or she receives the
    feedback from the experiment. It may also be the case that this same sense can scan the environment in actual time
    and detect change as well.</p>
  <p>Another hypothesis put forth at SAIC was that laboratory remote viewing experiments are most likely to be
    successful if the pool of potential targets is neither too narrow nor too wide in terms of the number of possible
    elements in the target. They called this feature the "target- pool bandwidth" and described it as the number of
    "differentiable cognitive elements." They reasoned that if the possible target set was too small, the viewer would
    see the entire set and be unable to distinguish that information from the psychic information. If the set was too
    broad, the viewer would not have any means for editing an extensive imagination.</p>
  <p>Combining these two results would indicate that a good target set would contain targets with high change in visual
    entropy, but that the set would contain a moderately-sized set of possibilities. The set of 100 National Geographic
    photographs used in the later days at SRI and at SAIC may have inadvertently displayed just those properties.</p>

  <h2>Remote Staring</h2>
  <p>Experiment 7, described in Appendix 2, provided results very different from the standard remote viewing work. That
    experiment was designed to test claims made in the Former Soviet Union and by some researchers in the United States,
    that individuals could influence the physiology of another individual from a remote location. The study was actually
    two separate replications of the same experiment, and both replications were successful from a traditional
    statistical perspective. In other words, it appeared that the physiology of one individual was activated when he or
    she was being watched by someone in a distant room. If these results are indeed sound, then they may substantiate
    the folklore indicating that people know when they are being observed from behind.</p>

  <h2>Enhanced Binary Computer Guessing</h2>
  <p>Experiment 2 was also very different from the standard remote viewing experiments, although it was still designed
    to test anomalous cognition. Three subjects attempted to use a statistical enhancement technique to increase the
    ability to guess forced choice targets with two choices. This clever computer experiment showed that for one
    subject, guessing was indeed enhanced from a raw rate of just above chance (51.6% instead of 50%) to an enhanced
    rate of 76 percent. The method was extremely inefficient, and it is difficult to imagine practical uses for this
    ability, if indeed it exists.</p>
