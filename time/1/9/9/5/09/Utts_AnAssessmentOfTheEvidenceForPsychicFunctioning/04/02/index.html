<p>Of the ten experiments done at SAIC, six of them involved remote viewing and four did not. Rather than list the
  details in the body of this report, Appendix 2 gives a brief description of the experiments. What follows is a
  discussion of the methodology and results for the experiments as a whole. Because of the fundamental differences
  between remote viewing and the other types of experiments, we discuss them separately.</p>
<p>In the memorandum of 25 July 1995, Dr. May provided the review team with details of the ten experiments, including a
  short title, number of trials, effect size and overall p-value for each one. His list was in time sequence. It is
  reproduced in Table 1, using his numbering system, with the experiments categorized by type, then sequentially within
  type. The effect size estimates are based on a limited number of trials, so they are augmented with an interval to
  show the probable range of the true effect (e.g. .124±.071 indicates a range from .053 to .195). Remember that an
  effect size of 0 represents chance, while a positive effect size indicates positive results.</p>
