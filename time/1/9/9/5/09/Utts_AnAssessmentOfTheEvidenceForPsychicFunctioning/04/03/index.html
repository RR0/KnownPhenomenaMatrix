<p>While Table 1 provides an overall assessment of the results of each experiment, it does so at the expense of
  information about variability among viewers and types of targets. In terms of understanding the phenomenon, it is
  important to break the results down into units that are as homogeneous as possible in terms of procedure, individual
  viewer and type of target. This is also important in order to assess the impact of any potential methodological
  problems. For example, in one pilot experiment (E6, AC in Lucid Dreams) viewers were permitted to take the targets
  home with them in sealed envelopes. Table 2 presents the effect size results at the most homogeneous level possible
  based on the information provided. For descriptions of the experiments, refer to Appendix 2. Overall effect sizes for
  each viewer and total effect sizes for each experiment are weighted according to the number of trials, so each trial
  receives equal weight.</p>
