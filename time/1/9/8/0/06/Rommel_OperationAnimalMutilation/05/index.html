<p> One major objective of this project was to gather information from  other states in order to assess the scope of the livestock mutilation  phenomenon. Judging from media coverage, I knew that mutilations had  been reported in states throughout the country. To evaluate these  incidents, I contacted the governor of every state requesting  information, as well as nine veterinarians affiliated with eight state  diagnostic laboratories.</p>
<p>  These include the Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory, College of  Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Science, Colorado State University;  Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, Iowa State University; Diagnostic  Laboratory, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State University;  Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, College of Veterinary Medicine,  University of Missouri; Montana Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory; New  Mexico Veterinary Diagnostic Service, New Mexico State University; and  Veterinary Laboratory, South Dakota State University; and Veterinarian  Laboratory, Texas A &amp; M. The complete reports furnished to me by  these laboratories are contained in the appendix.</p>
<p>  As in New Mexico, newspaper accounts from these states also tend to  stress the bizarre and mysterious nature of livestock mutilations.  Similarly, the data I received from qualified professional  investigators and veterinarians, especially those 
affiliated with animal diagnostic laboratories, confirm the conclusions  I have reached -- that the vast majority of reported mutilations are  scavenger-induced.</p>
<p>  In three of these states -- Colorado, Montana, and Arkansas -- the  livestock mutilation phenomenon resembles that described in New Mexico  in terms of the large number of reported cases and in the hysteria, and  interest these incidents had generated. In addition, certain incidents  reported in these states have contributed substantially to the lore  surrounding the mutilation phenomenon. A fourth state -- Oklahoma -- is  also of interest in that the livestock mutilation problem was  investigated in 1974 by an official task force. I will thus begin my  evaluation of the data obtained from other areas with a discussion of  the incidents that have occurred in Colorado, Montana, Arkansas, and  Oklahoma.</p>
<p>  This will be followed by a summary of information obtained from the  other 19 states which furnished me with data on livestock mutilations.  Seven states never responded to my inquiry. As for the remaining 20  states, the officials I contacted informed me either that their state  had had no mutilations as defined by this project, or that they did not  keep any central statistics on the problem. These states, which will  not be mentioned again, include Alaska, California, Connecticut,  Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan,  Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South  Carolina, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and
West Virginia.</p>
